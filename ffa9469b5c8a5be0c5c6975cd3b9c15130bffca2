Ping1D has an unstable ABR procedure, where it fails to communicate with 115200 or 9600
in a not deterministic way.
Such problem breaks the find device logic, where Ping1D fails to answer 115200 and
answers with 9600, this will make the 9600 baud rate valid and invalidate 115200 baud rates.
To avoid such problem, we are going to drop 9600 baud rate and ask the user to use manual connection.
The user can also update the firmware to use the automatic baud rate feature.
